	Generics

	Questions


1.	Is it possible to define your own generic classes? But generic methods?

    A: Yes it is possible to define both.

2.      How do you declare the type parameter(s) for a generic class? But for a method?

    A: class MyGenerics<T>{
    	
    		private T topic;
			public Message(T topic) {
				this.topic = topic;
			}

			public T getTopic() {
				return topic;
			}
		}

3.      Can you create a generic method in a generic class, where the generic method has a different type parameter than the class? If yes, provide an example.

    A:	Yes, I can.
    
    	class Message<T> {
			private T topic;
			public Message(T topic) {
				super();
				this.topic = topic;
			}

			public T getTopic() {
				return topic;
			}

			public <G> int otherType(G other) {
				return 0;
			}
		}

4.      Does Java create multiple types for each invocation of a parameterized type? How many of them?

    A:	Yes Java creates an instance of the parametrized type for each invocation, equal to the number of different types.

5.      Can you call a method declared with a type List<Object> with a parameter of type List<String>? If not, how can you make the call legal?

    A: No, you can not, it is possible only if you use the wildcard character.
    
    public int otherType(List<? extends Object> other){
		return 0;
	}

6.      If you use wildcards, can you modify the parameter inside the method call? Why?

    A: Yes, because wildcard means any type is accepted.

7.      Explain the following method declaration syntax:
        public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list)

    A: <T extends Comparable<? super T>> this is used to explain what is "T".
       "T" must be a type that extends Comparable which takes as a generic argument a class which is a super class of T.
        
8.      When do you use a generic method and when a method with wildcards?

    A: Wildcards are used when you want to specify a type which comes from a hierarchy.
       Type parameters support multiple bounds, wildcards don't. 

9.      Can you call generics code from "old" non-generics code? But non-generics code from generics code?

    A: Calling generics code from non-generics code is not possible, however calling non-generics code from generics code works fine.

10.     Can you use statics in generic classes?

    A: You can not use static methods in generic classes.
       The class' type parameters are used for instance methods and instance fields.

11.     Provide two examples where you can get an unchecked warning.

	Problems


1.	Consider the following:

    interface Sink<T> { 
        flush(T t); 
    }

    Imagine using it as demonstrated by the code below.

    public static <T> T writeAll(Collection<T> coll, Sink<T> snk){ 
        T last;
        for (T t : coll) { 
            last = t;
            snk.flush(last);
        }
        return last;
    }
    ...
    Sink<Object> s;
    Collection<String> cs;
    String str = writeAll(cs, s);
    
    
    Is the code legal? If yes, why? If not, fix it.
    
    
2.      Transform the following code to use generics:

    interface Collection { 
        public boolean containsAll(Collection c);
        public boolean addAll(Collection c);
    }

3.      Write a generic function to sort any collections using bubble sort.

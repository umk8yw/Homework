	Questions


1.	What are the main differences between an array and an ArrayList? 

	A: ArrayLists can store only object an Arrays only primitives.
	   Before it is created you can not change the size of an Array, an ArrayList can resize itself when it is needed.
	   When you create an Array you must specify its size and type, with ArrayList you can use Generics and you do not have to know its size.

2.	There is a good practice in OO programming not to have public attributes. Think of a good reason why the designers of Java have broken this rule and have exposed the length attribute of arrays? 

	A:	

3.	Which of the following are ordered collections and which ones are not:
a.	HashSet
b.	TreeSet
c.	WeakHashMap
d.	TreeMap
e.	LinkedList	

	A: Only TreeSet and TreeMap are ordered.

4.	What is an Iterator? What is the difference between an Iterator and an Enumerator?

	A: An iterator is an object of a class that implements the Iterator interface.
	   It is used to traverse the elements of a collection allowing the user to retrieve the values.
	   The differences between Iterator and Enumerator are that, the Iterator is newer, it can be used to manipulate(add, remove) elements from a collection.
	   Enumerator is not supported by all classes from Collection. 
	   It acts like a read-only interface, allowing only read-only operations like fetch and traverse.
	
5.	What is the difference between Collections and Maps?

	A: The difference between Collections and Maps is that the Map interface is a collection of key-value pairs.

6.	Make a comparison between SoftReference and WeakReferences? 

	A: It all depends on the garbage collector, a WeakReference is not strong enough to hold an objects reference in memory.
	   A SoftReference is just like a WeakReference, but it can keep an objects reference in memory a little more.

7.	How can you obtain a sychronized (thread-safe) version of a LinkedList?

	A: List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));

8.	What specific List would you chose as a container if you would have to perform random removals and wish for the best performance? 

	A:

	Problems


1.	Write a program that does the following: 
a.	creates two ArrayLists each with at least three elements (call them a and b) 
b.	merges b into a in an interleaved fashion (so if a=[a,b,c] and b=[w,x,y,z], then a becomes [a, w, b, x, c, y, z]) 
c.	removes every second element from b (so b would become [w,y]) 
d.	finally removes from a every element that is in b (so a would become [a, b, x, c, z]) 

2.	Create a class Country containing two attributes: Name and Capital, both Strings. Make it Comparable so that the comparison only cares about the country�s name. Fill an ArrayList with objects of your class. Demonstrate that sorting works properly. Now make a Comparator that only cares about the capital and demonstrate that sorting works properly. Perform a binary search for the country whose capital is Paris using your second Comparator.

3.	Write a program to implement a memory sensitive cache.

4.	Write a program illustrating a �publish-subscribe� mechanism using a simple interface and and a Collection.

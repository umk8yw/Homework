	Interfaces & Inner-Classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Questions:

1.	What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class? Explain when it is best to use Interfaces and when abstract classes.

  A:  If you need multiple inheritance/implementations, is better to use Interfaces.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  Interface                       |  Abstract class               |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  - does not contain constructor  |  - contains constructor       |
  |  - contains only the signature of|  - can contain only the       |
  |  the method (name + paramethers) |  signature of the method, but |
  |                                  |  it can also the method with  |
  |                                  |  its implementation           |
  |  - suports multiple inheritance  |  - does not support multiple  |
  |                                  |  inheritance                  |
  |  - does not have access modifiers|  - supports all access        |
  |  everything is public            |  modifiers                    |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

2.	Write a short code snippet to define a new interface I3 that inherits two existing interfaces I1 and I2. What happens if the definitions of the I1 and I2 are:
public interface I1 {
  void foo();
}
public interface I2 {
  public void foo();
}

  A:  here everything is fine

What about if the two interfaces are:
public interface I1 {
  public void foo();
}
public interface I2 {
  public int foo();
}

  A:  but here is a problem, because an override method must have the same return type.
      If we let it like this, the compiler won't know which foo() method to choose.

3.	Point any errors in the code snippet below and explain them:
interface Shape {
   int getArea();   <---  if we comment this the problem will be solved
   void draw();
}

public class Tile {
   private int width = 0, height = 0;
   int getArea() { return height * width;}
   void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; }
   void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; }
}

public class TileShape extends Tile implements Shape {
   public void draw() {
     System.out.println(“This a tile with area of: “ + this.getArea());
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     TileShape tileShape = new TileShape();
     tileShape.setHeight(10);
     tileShape.setWidth(10);
     Shape shape = tileShape;
     shape.draw(); 
   }
}

  A: The problem is that there is an intersection type containing a interface containing a method whose signature matches a method on the Tile class.

4.	What are the access modifiers of the fields and methods inside the interface? Is it possible to declare an interface as being static? What about private? 

  A:  From Java 8 it is possibe to declare static and default methods and they will be able to have their own implementation. 
      A static mehod can not be inherit from a superinterface.
      All fields of an interface are public, static and final.
      An interface can not be declared nighter static nor private.

5.	What are the differences between inner classes and nested classes?

  A:  A nested class is an inner static class.
      For creating an instance of an inner class, first must be created an instrance of the base class:
          BaseClass c = new BaseClass();
          InnerClass i = c.new InnerClass();
      Creating an instrance of a nested class:
          BaseClass.Nestedlass n = new BaseClass.NestedClass();

6.	Provide a short code snippet to define an inner anonymous class:
a.	That implements a given interface I1 with one method: void f();
    A:
      interface I1{
        void f();
      }

      public class Anonymous {

        public void method(I1 i){}
  
        public static void main(String[] args){
    
          Anonymous a = new Anonymous();
          a.method(new I1() {
      
            public void f() {}
          });
        }
      }

b.	That extends a given class C1;
    A: 
      abstract class C1{
        abstract void f();
      }

      public class Anonymous {

        public void method(C1 c){}
  
        public static void main(String[] args){
    
          Anonymous a = new Anonymous();
          a.method(new C1() {
      
            public void f() {}
          });
        }
      }

c.	That extends a given class C2 with no default constructor and a constructor with two string parameters.
    A:
      abstract class C2{
        C2(String s1, String s2){}
        abstract void f();
      }

      public class Anonymous {

        public void method(C2 c){}
  
        public static void main(String[] args){
    
          Anonymous a = new Anonymous();
          a.method(new C2("first", "second") {
      
            public void f() {}
          });
        }
      }

7.	Which of the following are true when talking about inner classes (non-anonymous):
a.	Can be declared inside other inner classes
b.	Can be declared inside methods and blocks of code
c.	Can access private members from the outer class(es)
d.	Can have more than one constructor
e.	Defines an IS-A relationship between the outer and the inner class
f.	Can be further extended by other classes

  A: a, b, c, d, f(can be extended by other inner classes)

8.	Given the code below, how can you access from the method f() the x member of the outer class?
…
public class A {
  private int x = 10;
  private class B {
    private int x = 20;
    public void f() {
      System.out.println(x);
    }
  } 
} 

  A: Create an instance of class A indise the f() method

    public class A {
      private int x = 10;

      private class B {
        private int x = 20;
    
        public void f() {
      
          A a = new A();
          System.out.println(a.x);
        }
      }

    } 

9.	Given the following interface definition:

public interface I1 {
  public interface I2 {
     void f2();
  }
  public void f1();
}

Which of the following definitions are correct (and explain) ?
1.
public class A implements I1 {

  public void f1() {};
}

2.
public class A implements I1 {
  public class A2 implements I2 {
     void f2() {};
  }
  public void f1() {};
}

3.
public class A2 implements I2 {
  public void f2() {}
}

4.
public class A2 implements I1.I2 {
  void f2();
} 

  A:  1 -> correct 
      2 -> wrong - the method f2() defined in A2 should be public, cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method
      3 -> correct if we add the following import statement import learn.inner.classes.I1.I2;
      4 -> wrong - a body should be added to the method, or make the class and the methos abstract

10.	Given the following class, how can you create a new instance of the classes A and B in the main method():

public class Test {
   class A {
   }
   static class B {
   }
}
class MyTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {

  A:
    Test test = new Test();
    
    A a = test.new A();
    
    Test.B b = new Test.B();
   }
}



	Problems:

1.	Modify the class below (using an inner class) to allow using it as an Iterator (make an example call of the method foo). 
public interface Iterator {
  boolean hasNext();
  Object next();
}
public class Map {
  private String[] directions = {“North”, “East”, “South”, “West”};
}
…
public void foo(Iterator it) {
 // …
}
  --> Map.java file

2.	Given the CDPlayer class with the definition below, extend the CDPlayer class and add the necessary changes so it can be used as iterator. (hint: create a method inside the derived class that returns an Iterator and uses an anonymous inner class do to this)
public interface Iterator {
  boolean hasNext();
  Object next();
}
public class CDPlayer {
  private String[] tracks = {“Track 1”, “Track 2”, “Track 3”};
  private int currentTrack;

  public void next() { //… }
  public void play() { //… }
  public void stop() { //… }
  public void prev() { //… }
}
public void foo(Iterator it) {
 // …
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Error handling with exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Questions:

1.	What information you can print about an exception?

  A:  You can print the message of the exception, the cause of the exception, the class where was the problem and all the StackTrace.

2.	What is the class name of the standard Java exception that does not have to be handled?

  A:  RuntimeException

3.	What is the exception restriction related to method overriding? Do constructors have the same restriction? Why?

  A:  If you override a method you can not add other thrown exceptions at its declaration. You can remove the initial one, but can't add new ones.
      If the method from the super class or interface doesn't throw an exception and you refer to your object as that type, you will get unexpected behaviour.
      Constructors does not have the same restriction.

4.a.	Is the exception specification part of the method signature? Prove your answer by writing a small piece of code to justify your answer; comment your proof.

  A:  No.

    interface First {
      void method(int i, double j, float f) throws AccessException;
    }

    public class Second implements First{
      public void method(int i, double j, float f){   <---  is not specified also the exception which is thrwon
        ~ code ~
      }
    }

4.b.	Which parts of the method declaration go in the method signature? 

  A:  Name of the method and its arguments.

5.	Knowing that 
System.out.print
does not throw any exception, consider the following of code:

  private static int getI() {
    int i = 0;
    try {
      System.out.println("i is " + ++i);
      i++;
      try {
        throw new Exception("Now i is " + i++);
      }
      catch (Throwable t) {
        i++;
      }
    }
    finally {
      System.out.println("finally i is " + i++);
      return i++;
    }
  }
What strings are printed to the console, and what is value getI() returns?

  A:  i is 1
      finally i is 4

      The value of i returned by getI() is 6.

	

  Problems:

1.	Follow the steps below to create a small Java program with 2 classes:
a.	create a class RandomPlay with a method that generates two random numbers between 1 and 10 (see java.lang.Math.random() for generating random numbers)
b.	if the difference of the 2 numbers is higher than 3, throw an exception you’ll specially define for this case
c.	add a main() method to class RandomPlay that repeatedly calls the first method until it throws no exception
d.	exit the program by printing the number of times the first method threw your exception
      --> RandomPlay.java file
2.	Consider the following class definitions:

public class Exception1 extends Exception {}
public class Exception2 extends Exception {}

and method:
	
public throwException() throws Exception1, Exception2 {
	    // method body not shown
	}

and the following 2 blocks of code:
block1:

try {
    throwException();
}
catch (Exception1 e) {
    System.err.println("Caught Exception1");
}
catch (Exception2 e) {
    System.err.println("Caught Exception2");
}

block2:
try {
    throwException();
}
catch (Exception e) {
    if(e.getClass().getName().equals(Exception1.class.getName()))
        System.out.println("Caught Exception1");
    else if(e.getClass().getName().equals(Exception2.class.getName()))
        System.out.println("Caught Exception2");
}

Replace the commented line in block 2 with your code so that block 2 has the same functionality as block 1.

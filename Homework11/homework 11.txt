	RMI
-------------------------------------

	Questions

1.	Which is the basic difference between the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and RMI?
2.	Which is the difference between the methods Naming.bind and Naming.rebind?
3.	Is it possible to start programmatically the registry? If yes, which is the difference between starting it manually and starting it programmatically?
4.	If the client of an RMI object is on another machine then where the object, the stub and skeleton code will run?
5.	What is wrong in the next remote interface definition:
	public interface PerfectTimeI extends Remote {
  	     long getPerfectTime();
        }


	Problems

1.	Write a code snippet for a client side lookup of an arbitrary remote interface.
2.	Write the remote interface and the implementation class for a remote object which provides the possibility to authorize a user using an id and a password, also provide the registration code of the remote object. The authorization should succeed always for simplicity.
